## CHT Hierarchy Generator

Simple python script to generate a custom address hierarchy for Community Health Toolkit

#### Requirements
The app requires you to satisfy two major requirement that are as follows:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Dotenv pip package

To install the dotenv package, run the following command:
```bash
# For linux users
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install python-dotenv

# For windows users
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install python-dotenv
```

> It is necessary to upgrade pip because it can throw a scary warning message, if the latest version is not installed.

#### Usage

Step 1: Create a location configuration `json` file called `locations.json` inside the `static` folder, with the address hierarchy and structre in the way you need to. You can take inspiration from the example above.

Step 2: Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the details as needed
> Note: The `LOCATION_INPUT_FILE` refers to the address hierarchy json file and the `LOCATION_OUTPUT_FILE` refers to the output csv file that stores the ID autogenerated from CouchDB

Step 3: Run the migration command
```bash
# For Linux Users
python3 main.py

# For Windows Users
python main.py
```
